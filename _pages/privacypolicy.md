# Privacy Policy
**Last updated**  
October 2nd 2022


This policy applies to all information collected or submitted within the Loopify iOS app.

## Information we collect

Although a Spotify account is required to authorise the use of Loopify, no user credentials are stored within the app: all authorisation is handled through Spotify's own web login page.

The user will need to grant access from their Spotify account to allow Loopify to read and modify the current playback state, and to read the most recently played track. This data is presented to the user in real time, but is not stored or saved in any way within Loopify.

## Technical details

To avoid users being continually logged out, Loopify will store an authentication token on the user's device, which grants access to the following [Spotify authorisation scopes](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/scopes/):
- user-read-playback-state
- user-modify-playback-state
- user-read-recently-played

Users can immediately revoke access by visiting [https://www.spotify.com/account/apps/](https://www.spotify.com/account/apps/) and logging out of Loopify.


## Your Consent

By using the Loopify app, you consent to the privacy policy.

## Contact

Please email [loopify@icloud.com](mailto: loopify@icloud.com) if you would like to discuss this policy further.
